# Common GA Panel Questions

## What is going on here?

After participating in general assembly's student panels over the last 7 years I have come up with several pieces of advice that I like to recommend as well as become familiar with several questions that are common to receive with students. An hour is only so long and it means that some great points that come up in one panel, aren't present in another. The goal of this document is to compile the advice given, particularly relevant to students who study at General Assembly in Australia.

## How does this document work?

The document is laid out in a question and answer format, my goal is to provide insight and answers from previous students from General Assembly in an effort to help out future students as they look to understand what the future holds for them in this industry.

## Hang on, I disagree with you OR you're missing a really important question.

Fantastic! I don't claim to have definitive answers on anything and in first writing, this is primarily based on my experience and limited knowledge, I would love to receive feedback and any suggestions and credit you accordingly, please contact me at [mikeyjc@gmail.com](mailto://mikeyjc@gmail.com?Subject=Common%20GA%20panel%20questions) with "GA Common panel questions" in the subject.

# The questions:

## The Course:

### Is it normal to get really stressed out during the course?

This is pretty common, most people have at least one bout of crying due to frustration. Learning the skills and tools inolved with software engineering can be a lot and typically teaches people a new way to think. I don't really have any advice, but just want to reassure you that it's a very common experience and you will make it through if you keep working at it.

## Technology:

### When should I decide whether or not to be a frontend or backend developer?

While you are a learning you will get a feel for which work comes more naturally and which work you tend to enjoy more, these can be good initial indicators for you when you go to look for your first job. However, the best thing you can do for yourself and your career is to keep yourself open to all aspects of your job. At the end of the day, you should have at least a broad understanding of how each part of the technology stack works. The more tasks you can be trusted with, the more your career will flourish.

### How should I stay up to date with technology?

???

### How much time should I spend on learning/other projects once I start working?

First of all, I want to highlight that spending time learning outside of work IS NOT a requirement for being in this industry. Everyone has a unique set of circumstances and not everyone has the time to learn/develop their skills outside of their regular work week.

Technology changes and that means whatever answer I give here can quickly go out of date. In the beginning of your career, you should try to focus on expanding your skillset to be as useful as possible in your current job, ask the more senior people on your team what they think will end up helping you the most, they should point you to relevant books/courses/newsletters. Another more general piece of advice is to not worry too much about specialising in your first role, you should build a stronger breadth of knowledge to help keep your options open in future, and to establish yourself as someone willing to move outside their comfort zone to find out how to fix a difficult problem.

## Interviewing:

### What should I spend my time on after the course is finished and before I get a job?

When it's time for you to start your first job, the difference between getting a job or not will not likely have anything to do with the technologies you have and have not learned about. My recommendation would be to ensure your interview skills are as good as they can be, especially if you don't have a lot of experience with interviews in general. If the outcomes team are comfortable with your interviewing skills and you feel confident, I would then recommend sourcing more opportunities through the other students in your cohort, other GA alumni or through contacting other professionals on linkedin.

If you truly believe that you have done enough in the above two suggestions, then start focusing on learning new and relevant technologies for the work you might end up doing.

### How should I prepare for my first tech interviews?



### What sort of questions should I ask in an interview?

Your goal in the interview should be to understand what you're going to get out of the job before ever working there, the following questions should be helpful:

- What would be your expectations for me in my first few months here?
- What things would I 
- Will I have access to mentors to help me develop my skills?
- What is the process like when things don't go as planned? (You're trying to find out what happens when things go wrong)
- How does the team celebrate wins? e.g. after a big release

### How do I know if a company is a good fit?
